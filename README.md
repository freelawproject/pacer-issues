# Welcome to the *unofficial* public PACER bug and feature tracker

After years of using PACER, thinking about its problems, and working with others in this space, we created this webpage as a place to consolidate all the great ideas. If you have an idea for PACER or a problem with how it works, you can enter it in this site for others to discuss. 

So far, we have more than 50 ideas and bugs, many of which were pulled from from [this tweet and its many responses][tweet]. We plan to build on this over time.

If you want to follow the discussions here, simply subscribe using this link:

That'll send you emails at good times.

Beyond that, it's pretty simple to join the conversation:

 - If you want to see other changes people are discussing, just [browse the current list of issues][issues]. 
 
 - If you want to share an enhancement to PACER or CM/ECF, just [start writing it here][enhancement] â€” the more detail, the better.
 
 - If you want to discuss a bug you've found in PACER or CM/ECF, just [start writing it here][bug].
 
We hope this collection of bugs and ideas will help catalog and demonstrate the pent up needs and desires of everyday PACER and CM/ECF users. We also hope it'll provide a place for discussing these issues so we can find solutions and brainstorm ideas for making things better.
